# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
install.packages("qdapRegex")
library(qdapRegex)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read_tsv('cocktail_data.tsv')

cocktail_data
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cocktail_fixed <- str_replace_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "<br>", "<br/>")

cocktail_final <- str_replace_all(cocktail_fixed, "<b4/>", "<br/>")

cocktail_data_fixed <- cbind(cocktail_data, cocktail_final)

cocktail_data_fixed$ingredients <- NULL

cocktail_data_fixed

cocktail_sep <- separate_longer_delim(cocktail_data_fixed, cocktail_final, delim = "<br/>")

cocktail_sep

remove <- c("oz", "drops", "drop", "drops", "dash", "dashes", "bsp", "(40% abv)", "(50% abv)", "(43% abv)", "(41% abv)", "(45% abv)", "(47% abv)", "(47.4% abv)", "(47.3% abv)", "3/4", "1/2", "1/4", "5/8", "3/8", "6/8", "7/8", "[()]")

cocktail_no_quan <- str_remove_all(cocktail_sep$cocktail_final, paste(remove, collapse = "|"))

cocktail_ingredients <- rm_number(cocktail_no_quan)

cocktail_df <- cbind(cocktail_sep, cocktail_ingredients)

cocktail_df$cocktail_final <- NULL

glimpse(cocktail_df)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredient_list <- cocktail_df[order(cocktail_df$cocktail_ingredients), ] %>%
  pull(cocktail_ingredients) %>%
  unique()

ingredient_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
summary(ingredient_list)

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top10_ingredients <- fct_lump_n(cocktail_df$cocktail_ingredients, n = 10)

top10_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_most_ingredients <- cocktail_df %>%
  count(name) %>%
  filter(n == max(n))
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_df %>%
  count(cocktail_ingredients) %>%
  filter(n == min(n))
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktail_w_rare <- cocktail_df %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(cocktail_ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$cocktail_ingredients) %>%
  pull(name) %>%
  unique()


```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktail_wo_rare <- cocktail_df %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(!(cocktail_ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$cocktail_ingredients)) %>%
  pull(name) %>%
  unique()
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
